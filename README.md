# ruby_recipes_chef

Work in progress project where you can choose a recipie based on a diet, nutrients,or ingredients

Uses https://www.edamam.com 's free recipe api with ruby but i do plan on making this same project with rust and python for fun

I will include documentation on how to enter values and queries when i get most of this project's functionallity finished.
